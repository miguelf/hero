# Harness-Facing Changes Must Cover All Install Targets

## Constraint

Do not implement or deliver a harness-facing change (instruction-file content,
routing guidance, slash commands, agents, skills, or anything `hero install`
propagates) that handles only **one** harness — most commonly Claude/`CLAUDE.md`.
Hero installs to **eight** targets: `opencode | cursor | claude | copilot | codex |
generic | grok | deepseek`. Every harness-facing change must account for all of them, or be
explicitly scoped with the reason the others are excluded.

## Why

Claude Code is the conspicuous outlier — it reads `CLAUDE.md` and has end-of-
session hooks (Stop/PreCompact). The other targets read `AGENTS.md`; hook support differs by harness (Codex also has a Stop hook). A change authored against `CLAUDE.md` or a Claude-only hook
silently breaks coverage for opencode, cursor, copilot, codex, generic, grok, and deepseek, and
the gap is invisible until someone runs Hero in those harnesses. This recurs
often enough to need an always-on guardrail. See
[[harness-instruction-file-survey]] and the `--target` set in
`internal/cli/install.go`.

## Instead

- **Author once, harness-agnostic.** Put the authoritative content in `.hero/`
  (knowledge/convention/skill), then let `hero install` propagation render it to
  each target.
- **Each target gets its own native root instruction file — there is no single
  canonical one.** Under the harness-native, target-aware install model,
  `hero install` writes the file each installed target natively reads: `claude`
  → `CLAUDE.md`, every other target (`opencode | cursor | copilot | codex |
  generic | grok | deepseek`) → `AGENTS.md`. Codex, Grok, and DeepSeek additionally receive Hero
  workflows as `command-*` skills in their native skill roots rather than a
  standalone commands directory. Both root files carry the **same** Hero-managed block body
  (rendered once, written into each target's file) — so "author once, propagate
  to every target" still holds for the *content*, it just lands in per-target
  files. There is **no** `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md` symlink/`@import` shim, and a
  target that was never installed gets **no** root file (upgrade respects the
  persisted installed-target set). See
  [[harness-native-install-target-aware-upgrade]].
- **Make AGENTS.md guidance self-contained and imperative** so a hookless harness
  can act on instruction alone. Treat the Claude Stop/PreCompact hook as an
  enhancement layered on top — never the mechanism. Never gate core behavior on a
  Claude-only hook.
- **Verify per-target propagation** before calling the change done — confirm the
  guidance lands in each target's instruction surface.
