# A symlinked hero folder is walked as empty

## Goal

When a project's hero folder (`.hero`) is a symlink to a directory elsewhere, Hero works exactly as if it were a real directory. Today it silently finds nothing.

## Kickoff

Found by the v0.35.3 pre-release audit. The user chose to hold the release until it is fixed. `filepath.Walk` and `filepath.WalkDir` never follow their root, so every walk rooted at the hero folder sees a single non-directory entry and stops. Fix those walks with one shared helper. Verify with `go test ./...` and a real `hero list` in a symlinked workspace.

## Root Cause

`filepath.Walk(root)` calls `os.Lstat(root)`. For a symlinked root, that describes the link (not a directory), so the walk never descends. Walks rooted *below* the hero folder, such as `.hero/knowledge`, are fine, because the OS resolves the symlinked parent component. Exactly four walks are rooted at the hero folder itself:

| Site | Effect |
|---|---|
| `spec.Discover` (`internal/spec/spec.go`) | Finds zero specs: `hero list` prints "No specs match", and every spec-reading command and MCP tool sees an empty workspace |
| `watch.Scan` (`internal/watch/watch.go`) | The watcher's snapshot is empty, so no change events |
| `validateSpecSources` (`internal/embeddings/chunker.go`) | Spec validation before embedding checks nothing |
| `lastTouchedAt` (`internal/serve/projectpage/data/identity.go`) | Reports the symlink's own mtime, not the newest spec's |

One adjacent site, found by the audit, has the same cause one level down. `install.FindNestedHeroDirs` (the "leftover standalone workspaces" migration hint) used `d.IsDir()` from `WalkDir`, so a nested workspace whose `.hero` is a symlink was not listed. That listing also feeds `hero install satellites --migrate-nested --apply`, which moves files out of a nested `.hero` and deletes it. For a linked `.hero` that would gut the link target (often another checkout's live workspace) and remove only the link. So once the hint lists it, the migration must refuse it.

Hero never creates a symlinked hero folder itself (satellites deliberately get none), so only hand-made layouts are affected.

## Fix

New `internal/fsutil` with `Walk` and `WalkDir`. When the root is a symlink that resolves, they walk the target but report every path under the original root. Callers that compare against or relativize to the hero dir therefore behave unchanged, including `Spec.Archived` stamping, `hiddenHeroPath` and the snapshots skip. A plain root or a broken link behaves exactly like `filepath.Walk`/`WalkDir`. The four sites switch to the helper.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-7:** WHEN the hero folder (or a nested `.hero`) is a Windows directory junction THE SYSTEM SHALL treat it like a symlink. Go 1.23+ reports a junction as `ModeIrregular` without `ModeDir`, and `EvalSymlinks` does not follow it, so it is resolved with `Readlink`. A real directory carrying a non-link reparse tag (`ModeDir|ModeIrregular`, e.g. a OneDrive placeholder) SHALL stay a plain directory.
- **AC-1:** WHEN the hero folder is a symlink to a directory THE SYSTEM SHALL discover its specs with paths under the hero folder, and stamp `Archived` correctly.
- **AC-2:** WHEN the hero folder is a symlink THE SYSTEM SHALL include its files in the watch snapshot, spec-source validation and last-touched time.
- **AC-3:** WHEN the walk root is not a symlink, or is a broken symlink, THE SYSTEM SHALL behave exactly like `filepath.Walk`/`WalkDir`.
- **AC-5:** WHEN a nested workspace's `.hero` is a symlink to a directory THE SYSTEM SHALL list it in the nested-workspace migration hint. A `.hero` that links to a file or dangles SHALL NOT be listed.
- **AC-6:** WHEN a nested `.hero` is a symlink THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse to plan or apply its migration (`ErrLinkedNestedHero`, naming the link target; a Windows junction, reported as `ModeIrregular`, is refused the same way), leave the target and the link untouched, and still migrate the other nested workspaces.
- **AC-4:** WHEN a user runs `hero list` in a project whose `.hero` is a symlink THE SYSTEM SHALL list its specs.

## Changes

1. `internal/fsutil/walk.go` (new: `Walk`, `WalkDir`) and `walk_test.go`.
2. `internal/spec/spec.go` (`Discover`) and `discover_symlink_test.go`.
3. `internal/watch/watch.go` (`Scan`) and `watch_test.go`.
4. `internal/embeddings/chunker.go` (`validateSpecSources`) and `chunker_test.go`.
5. `internal/serve/projectpage/data/identity.go` (`lastTouchedAt`) and `identity_test.go`.
6. `internal/install/satellite_detect.go` (`FindNestedHeroDirs`, `isSymlinkToDir`) and `satellite_detect_test.go`.
8. Junctions: `internal/fsutil/walk.go` (`resolveRoot` with swappable `lstat`/`stat`/`readlink`/`evalSymlinks`; `Readlink` for junctions); `internal/install/satellite_detect.go` (`isSymlinkToDir` accepts `ModeIrregular`); the migration guard refuses link types only when not `ModeDir`; tests.
7. `internal/install/satellite_migrate.go` (`ErrLinkedNestedHero`, refused in `PlanMigration`, so `ApplyMigration` refuses too), `internal/cli/install_satellites.go` (apply skips and continues), `satellite_migrate_apply_test.go` and `install_satellites_linked_test.go`.

## Completion Ledger

### Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion (abbreviated) | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AC-1: Discover through a symlink | DONE | `TestDiscoverFollowsSymlinkedHeroDir` checks the paths stay under the link and that `Archived` is a=false, b=true. With the old walker it fails: "discovered 0 specs" |
| 2 | AC-2: watch / validate / last-touched | DONE | `TestScan_followsSymlinkedHeroDir`, `TestValidateSpecSourcesFollowsSymlinkedHeroDir` (an unreadable spec.md must be reported, which proves the walk descended) and `TestLastTouchedAtFollowsSymlinkedHeroDir` (a distinctive future mtime, so the link's own mtime cannot pass). All three fail with the old walkers |
| 3 | AC-3: unchanged otherwise | DONE | `TestWalkPlainRootUnchanged` and `TestWalkBrokenSymlinkRootReportsLikeFilepathWalk`. The full suite passes |
| 5 | AC-5: nested symlinked .hero in migration hint | DONE | `TestFindNestedHeroDirsFollowsSymlinkedHero`: a link to a dir is listed; a link to a file and a dangling link are not. With the old code it fails: "got [], want [apps/web]" |
| 6 | AC-6: migration refuses a linked nested .hero | DONE | `TestMigrationRefusesLinkedNestedHero` checks that plan and apply both return `ErrLinkedNestedHero` and that the target and link are intact. `TestMigrateNestedApplySkipsLinkedHero` runs the real `install satellites --migrate-nested --apply --yes --force`: it prints "Skipped apps/web", leaves the target spec and the link in place, and migrates the real `engines/mlx`. Without the guard, apply moved the target's spec and deleted the link, which confirms the audit's blocker was real |
| 7 | AC-7: Windows junctions | DONE | The user chose to verify by reading, since there is no Windows test runner. The junction logic is exercised on darwin by stubbing the fs calls to report exactly what Go's `os/types_windows.go` reports. `TestWalkDescendsJunctionRoot` fails with the previous `resolveRoot` ("not linked"). `TestResolveRootIgnoresNonLinkReparsePoints` covers the cloud placeholder dir and an irregular file. `TestIsSymlinkToDirRecognisesJunction` covers the nested hint. `GOOS=windows go vet` is clean. Not executed on Windows |
| 4 | AC-4: hero list end-to-end | DONE | A freshly built binary in a temp repo whose `.hero` is a symlink: `hero list` shows `a`, and `hero status` counts 1 upcoming and 1 completed. Before the fix: "No specs match" |

### Changes

| # | Changes item (abbreviated) | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | fsutil | DONE | `TestWalkDescendsSymlinkedRoot` and `TestWalkDirDescendsSymlinkedRoot` |
| 2 | Discover | DONE | — |
| 3 | watch | DONE | — |
| 4 | embeddings | DONE | — |
| 5 | identity | DONE | — |
| 6 | nested-workspace hint | DONE | — |
| 7 | migration guard | DONE | — |
| 8 | junctions | DONE | Verified by reading on Windows (the user's choice), plus stubbed tests |

### Exercise-the-feature check

- [x] Ran the real `hero list` and `hero status` binary in a symlinked workspace (AC-4). Each consumer test was falsified against the old walkers.

### Excellence Bar self-check

- [x] Yes. Every walk rooted at the hero folder is covered (enumerated from all `filepath.Walk`/`WalkDir` call sites), and walks rooted below it were shown to be unaffected.
