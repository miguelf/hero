# chet-bellows's handoff

## Session goal

> Ship a verified Hero release containing the completed MCP tool metadata contract for hero-code while keeping the superseded interactive CLI donor branch evidence-only.

_possibly stale — 140 commit(s) since, last set 53d 7h ago_

## Last user ask

> can you inspect all the work that has gone on over the last 2 weeks or so - see if its good - good quality - correctly done etc - nothing missed etc.

_possibly stale — 12 commit(s) since, last set 1h 22m ago_

## Suggested next prompt

> let's tackle E2E Onboarding Suite — Fresh Repo to Productive Workspace

_Rationale: highest-priority ready work: E2E Onboarding Suite — Fresh Repo to Productive Workspace (`e2e-onboarding`)_

_Source: auto-derived from open feature — `hero next suggest "..."` to override._

## Recent reflections

- Repo-scoped graph identity must propagate into every derived index; node_index kept the old two-column uniqueness after graph v5 and made valid sibling keys fatal.
- Grok Build 1.0.4 inspect --json normalizes AGENTS.md as Agents.md; qualify native loading by source type and .grok path suffix, not display casing.
- Release rehearsal exposed Unix-only file locks after native tests passed. Added a shared build-tagged lock primitive, Windows cross-build CI, direct failure-path coverage, and completed a clean cold audit plus six-target snapshot verification.
- Tracker activity now has one provider-owned consumer contract: tracker_updated_at; import time, refresh time, and spec mtime are never substitutes.
- Tracker-backed diagnosis postback was never a hidden hook; it was an explicit agent closing step. Hero Code's 2026-07-15 hardening blocked all generic sync and exposed only import, making attach/comment unreachable while hero_diagnose also omitted the publish contract.
