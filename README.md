# Hero

Hero gives AI coding tools durable project memory and a verified delivery
system, so decisions survive sessions and agents finish work against evidence.

Project memory is the headline: Hero keeps intent, decisions, corrections,
conventions, evidence, failures, and current state in a project-owned `.hero/`
corpus. Verified delivery is the connected execution system: specs bound the
work, specialized agents implement it, and Completion Ledgers, cold audits,
builds, and tests establish whether it is done.

Memory informs delivery. Delivery leaves decisions, evidence, corrections, and
a current handoff for later sessions. Together, they give each new session the
project context it needs and a clear path to verified completion.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries do not require Go.

macOS or Linux with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install hero-engine/tap/hero
```

Linux install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hero-engine/hero-releases/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows with Scoop:

```powershell
scoop bucket add hero-engine https://github.com/hero-engine/scoop-bucket
scoop install hero
```

Windows PowerShell install script:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hero-engine/hero-releases/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The [installation guide](web/docs/src/getting-started/installation.md) covers
direct downloads and source builds.

## First project

Run these commands from the repository root:

<!-- hero-quickstart -->
```bash
hero init
hero install project . --target codex
hero status
```

Replace `codex` with `opencode`, `cursor`, `claude`, `copilot`, `generic`, or
`grok` or `deepseek` for another supported target. Hero renders workflows into each target's
native surfaces. Claude receives command files; Codex, Grok, and DeepSeek receive
`command-*` workflow skills; other targets receive their supported native
surfaces and root instructions. Do not assume slash commands exist everywhere.

DeepSeek (desktop app or `dsh`) loads Hero's MCP server from its home patch after a
project install; restart the app. See [DeepSeek setup](MCP-SETUP.md#deepseek-harness-dsh).

The default setup combines Core with Engineering, including lightweight PM and
QA assistance used inside engineering workflows. Focused PM, QA, and Sales
setups are optional and maturity-bounded:

```bash
hero domain list
hero domain enable qa
hero install project . --target codex
```

## Project memory

Start or resume work by asking your installed harness to resume the project, or
use the CLI directly:

```bash
hero resume
hero status
hero search "OAuth session handling"
hero ask "What is our retry policy?"
hero relevant src/auth/session.go src/auth/middleware.go
hero why session-retry
hero blocked
```

Capture durable context deliberately. Notes, conventions, decisions, and
handoff projections are writes to the repository-owned corpus; search and
retrieval are reads.

```bash
hero note session-retry
hero next
hero recap --since 2d
```

Inside an installed harness, natural-language requests route to its native Hero
workflow. For example: “resume this project,” “design CSV export,” or “diagnose
the login timeout.”

## Verified delivery

The normal engineering loop is:

1. Design a feature or diagnose a bug into an approved spec.
2. Deliver against its acceptance criteria and project conventions.
3. Record the Completion Ledger and run the project build/tests.
4. Run a fresh, independent cold delivery audit.
5. Close once with `hero spec verify <slug>`.

```bash
hero spec score csv-export
hero spec deliver csv-export --manual
hero spec verify csv-export
```

`hero spec verify` checks the Completion Ledger, cold audit, acceptance-criteria
coverage, and configured build/test command. When the hard gates pass, it marks
the spec complete and archives it. `hero spec complete` exists as a manual
administrative path; it is not the normal evidence-backed delivery close.

Use the active harness workflow for agent execution. The CLI is useful for
inspection, automation, scoring, and the final verification gate:

```bash
hero list --ready --sort priority
hero queue --format kickoff
hero diff .hero/planning/features/csv-export/spec.md
hero drift csv-export
hero ac list csv-export
hero coverage csv-export
```

`hero drift` and `hero coverage` exit non-zero when they find drift or missing
coverage; that is a failed gate to address, not a broken invocation.

## Monorepos: one corpus, thin satellites

Initialize Hero once at the repository root. When a harness opens inside a
subproject, materialize a thin harness-native satellite tree that points back
to the root content:

```bash
hero install satellites                    # guided candidate review
hero install satellites --yes              # accept detected candidates
hero install satellites --repair           # reconcile satellite trees
hero install satellites --migrate-nested   # print a legacy migration plan
```

A monorepo has one root `.hero` corpus. Satellites are not nested Hero
workspaces. Do not run `hero init` inside a subproject under an existing Hero
root.

Repair the intended install scope explicitly:

```bash
hero install project . --target codex --repair
hero install satellites --repair
hero check
hero doctor
```

`hero doctor` diagnoses binary, schema, and installed-target mismatches.
`hero check` reports workspace and corpus health.

## Optional integrations and runtime surfaces

| Capability | Availability | Prerequisite and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| MCP project-memory tools | Shipped | An initialized workspace and harness MCP configuration. The runtime `tools/list` response is the inventory authority after filtering. |
| Local `hero serve` dashboard/API | Shipped locally | Register local projects deliberately. Team or external access changes the trust boundary. |
| Tracker operations | Optional | Configure GitHub, Jira, Linear, or GitLab credentials. Mutations require explicit consent for the exact issue and action. |
| Code-host operations | Optional | Configure a supported code-host connection. Reads do not imply permission for writes. |
| Cross-repository peering | Optional | Register reachable sibling repositories and manifests. Requests use asynchronous Project Mail. |
| Headless agent runtime | Preview | Configure a model provider, credentials, and execution environment. Do not treat preview jobs as unsupervised or production-ready. |

See [MCP Setup](MCP-SETUP.md), [Cross-Repo Peering](CROSS-REPO-PEERING.md),
and [Team Server](TEAM-SERVER.md).

## Cross-repository work

Each Hero project keeps its own graph. Registered peers exchange asynchronous
Project Mail; sending never launches a model or writes the receiver's tree.

```bash
hero admin repos add app ../app
hero peer manifest
hero peer list
hero peer call app --mode=advisory --reason="Confirm the API contract" \
  "Is the error envelope stable?"
hero handoff order-failure app --reason="Implementation belongs to app"
```

The receiver must inspect and explicitly promote a work-transfer message:

```bash
hero mail show <message-id>
hero handoff receive <message-id> --type bug
```

```

Specs, knowledge, and projected handoff files are committed. Generated
databases, credentials, sessions, and local overlays remain ignored.

## Build from source

Building from source requires the Go version declared by `go.mod`, currently
Go 1.26.6:

```bash
make build
make test
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Prebuilt binary installation does not require Go.
