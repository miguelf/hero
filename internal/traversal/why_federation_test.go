// (the team-oauth case).
//
// Node identity is (type, key, repo), so a federated peer scan that ingests
// a slug under its own repoKey leaves the local partition's copy live
// alongside it. resolveTarget must:
//
//   - return the LOCAL node when it is live, never a peer copy, and
//   - keep doing so after a sibling ingest of the same slug — a peer copy
//     neither shadows (masquerades as) nor tombstones the local one.
//
// This test previously characterized the OPPOSITE, because identity was
// (type, key) alone: the sibling ingest tombstoned the local node, and the
// test asserted that a local query then failed. That was the team-oauth
// bug, pinned as if it were the contract. Repo-scoped identity is what
// makes the wished-for behavior in the bullets above actually true.

// the local node was gone, so a local query failed. Repo-scoped identity
