	Use:   "upgrade",

	Long: `Updates agents, commands, and skills to match the installed hero binary version.

Files that you've customized are preserved — only unmodified files are updated.
Use --force to overwrite customized files.

Upgrade is harness-native and target-aware: it regenerates the managed region
only in the root instruction file each previously-installed target natively
reads — CLAUDE.md for Claude, .github/copilot-instructions.md for Copilot,
AGENTS.md for every other target. The
previously-installed set is read from .hero/install-state.json (union with a
filesystem probe). If Claude was never a target, upgrade never creates a
CLAUDE.md; likewise it never conjures an AGENTS.md for a Claude-only repo.

An instruction file whose target is not in the resolved set is never deleted
by default — its managed region is kept current. Pass
--prune-orphaned-instruction-files to remove such a file, and only when its
entire content is Hero-managed (any user content outside the markers is always
preserved).

When multiple AI tools are installed (e.g. both .opencode/ and .claude/),
upgrade walks every detected target by default. Use --target to narrow.

Examples:

  hero upgrade                       Upgrade every previously-installed target
  hero upgrade --target claude       Upgrade only the claude target
  hero upgrade --target claude --target opencode    Upgrade two targets
  hero upgrade --dry-run             Show what would change without modifying anything
  hero upgrade --force               Overwrite even customized files
  hero upgrade --prune-orphaned-instruction-files   Remove Hero-managed-only orphan root files`,

// anyway: it decides "is this Hero's file?" by matching a checksum
// recorded by some earlier binary, but every version embeds different
// content and users install arbitrary point releases, so on-disk will
// never reliably match a recorded checksum. Trying to match it just
// makes upgrade refuse to overwrite our own files. So: Force is always
