// parentWatchdogInterval is how often the portable poll checks ppid.
// 30s is a deliberate tradeoff: an orphan lives at most ~30s past its
// parent's death, which is invisible operationally, while the poll cost
// is one getppid() syscall per tick — negligible.
//
// It is a var (not const) so tests can shrink it to exercise the poll
// loop quickly; production code never reassigns it.
var parentWatchdogInterval = 30 * time.Second

// Seam vars default to the real runtime functions; tests override them to
// exercise the reparent-decision branch in-process without faking an OS
// reparent. Production code never reassigns these.

// startParentWatchdog launches the parent-liveness backstop. It first
// arms the OS-native fast path (Linux: PR_SET_PDEATHSIG; darwin: no-op),
// then runs a portable ppid poll that covers platforms without a native
// signal (notably macOS). The poll exits the process only when we've been
// reparented to launchd/init (ppid==1) OR the original parent is confirmed
// dead. A bare ppid change (an intermediate wrapper exited while the
// session is still live) is a false positive and is ignored.
//
// onExit runs immediately before the process exits. It exists because the
// watchdog terminates via os.Exit, which does NOT run deferred functions —
// so Run()'s `defer release()` is skipped on this path and the singleton
// pidfile would leak. This is the dominant real-world leak: a harness that
// dies without closing our stdin (crash, SIGKILL, fd handed to a survivor)
// orphans us, and the watchdog is then the ONLY thing that reaps us. Pass
// the release func so the exit is as clean as the stdin-EOF path.
//
// It fires ONLY when the parent is already dead, so it can never disrupt
// a live session.
// The returned channel is closed when the watchdog goroutine has fully
// exited (after `done` is closed). It exists as a happens-before join for
// tests that overwrite the package-level seam vars in cleanup — restoring
// them while the goroutine is still mid-tick reading them is a data race
// (-race catches it in CI). Production callers discard it: the goroutine
// simply dies with the process.
