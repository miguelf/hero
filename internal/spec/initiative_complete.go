// InitiativeReadyToComplete reports whether an initiative should be
// auto-completed because every one of its children is already a completed
// spec. It is the single completion decision shared by two call sites:
//
//   - the in-process side-effect in `hero spec verify` (autoCompleteParentIfReady),
//     which fires when the last not-yet-completed child is verified, and
//   - the standalone reconcile re-check in `hero check --reconcile`, which
//     recovers an initiative whose children are all already completed and
//     archived (no child verified in the current process).
//
// Keeping the gate in one place guarantees the two paths can never diverge.
// Two gates run: a roster gate (every child the initiative declares — see
// DeclaredChildren — must resolve to a materialized, finished spec) and a
// child-count gate (at least one materialized spec must declare this
// initiative as its parent, and all such specs must be completed).
//
// It returns false for a nil parent, a non-initiative, or an already-completed
// initiative — so callers can pass any candidate without pre-filtering.

// workspace's own convention (and `hero spec verify`'s refusal to run
// delivery gates against a decision) terminates them at StatusAccepted
// instead. The remaining knowledge types have no completion lifecycle either
// and are finished once filed, at StatusActive — mirroring the same mapping
// statusFromPath already uses when inferring a spec's status from its
// archival location.
